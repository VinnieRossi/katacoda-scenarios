In this scenario you will learn more about developing Spring Boot applications using the [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar) platform. We will be building a simple Spring Boot application which produces messages to and consumes messages from a JBOSS AMQ resource.

## What we're covering

We're going to be going over message queues via JBOSS AMQ. This means we're going to be creating all of the expected components that we need for messaging, including *listeners*, *receivers*, and *producers*. Through these different objects, we will be able to send messages into and read them from a queue that we'll be creating. Ours will be a simple queue that handles simple message elements, but we can modify the queue to handle any type of content and become very flexible.

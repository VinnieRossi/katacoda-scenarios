In this scenario you will learn more about developing Spring Boot applications using the [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar) platform. We will be building a simple
Spring Boot Web Application that's using REST services.

## What we'll be covering

In this module we'll be covering how to incorporate Spring MVC with REST services and creating an application that will modify data using a basic **C.R.U.D.** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. We're going to create a specific endpoint for each piece of functionality and take a look at how we can go about modifying our data that way using our REST endpoints. After that we'll deploy our application and test it through OpenShift!

We're going to be using the application that we went over in the *Spring MVC* module and building on top of the functionality covered there so make sure you're familiar with the basics of Spring MVC already, although we will be doing some recap.
